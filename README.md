## ML-in-a-box

This repository contains details for the Paperspace ML-in-a-box environments. Paperspace supports both Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 20.04, each in separate directories.

Ubuntu 22.04 version is required for H100 machines and recommended for A100s.
Ubuntu 20.04 version is recommended for any other machine type available on Paperspace.

These distinctions are mainly due to Nvidia driver versions needed for different generations of Nvidia hardware.

These templates can be used to spin up a Core Machine on Paperspace.

## Compatibility

Both environments now include Node.js 20.x, ensuring compatibility with modern web frameworks like Next.js 15.5+ (as used in HustleCodeX v2.0.0).
